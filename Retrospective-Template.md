TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done:
**4/4**
- Total points committed vs. done: **12/12**
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team):
**56h planned, 56h 50m spent**

Our Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

The estimation we did on the development tasks was not so far from the actual time spent, but we didn't consider too much the problems that could have occurred during the learning of spring-boot (cause the most of us didn't know how to use it). 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

Positive: 
1) the agile way is such an useful tool to develop easier and faster
2) the teamwork coesion boost the process to overcome obstacles
3) work on small tasks helps you to focus on small problems at the time

Negative:
1) The coesion between team members is needed
2) Sometimes there is the need to adapt your solution to other's work 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

We didn't have a previous retrospective
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  
See previous answer

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

We will have a daily (or at least every two/three days) scrum to coordinate better the work between team members

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

Our team showed coesion between team members and each one of us was ready to help someone with less experience
