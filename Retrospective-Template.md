TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
4/4
- Total points committed vs. done 
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
56h 50m / 56h

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |         |        |            |              |
| n      |         |        |            |              |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

The estimation we did on the development task was not so far from the actual time spent, but we didn't consider too much the problems that could have occurred during the learning of spring-boot (cause the most of us didn't know how to use it). 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
Positive: 
1) the agile way is such an useful tool to develop easier and faster
2) the teamwork coesion boost the process to overcome obstacles
3) work on small tasks helps you to focus on small problems at the time

Negative:
1) The coesion between team members is needed
2) Sometimes there is the need to adapt your solution to other's work 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

Our team showed coesion between team members and each one of us was ready to help someone with less experience
