### Detailed statistics

| Story                   | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |

| Waiting time estimation | 1       |  2     | 2h         | 2h           |

- Estimated average hours per task: **3.5h**
- Actual average hours per task: **3.66h**
- Estimated average hours per task std. deviation: **3.08**
- Actual average hours per task std. deviation: **3.86**
- Total task estimation error ratio (sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent): **0.02**

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- We included the time dedicated to unit testing, E2E testing and code review in the time estimation for each task. To provide an amount of time spent on testing, we will use the following measures:
  - 10% of the time of each task is dedicated to **unit testing**
  - 5% of the time of each task is dedicated to **E2E testing**
  - 5% of the time of each task is dedicated to **code review**
  - An exception was made for 1 task, which was specifically dedicated to E2E testing


- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: **5.4h**
  - Total hours spent: **5.3h**
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: **7**
  - Coverage (if available): **91% of all methods, 93% of lines of code**
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: **4.7h**
  - Total hours spent: **4.64h**
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: **2.7h**
  - Total hours spent: **2.64h**

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

The estimation we did on the development tasks was not so far from the actual time spent, but we didn't consider too much the problems that could have occurred during the learning of spring-boot (cause the most of us didn't know how to use it). 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

Positive: 
1) the agile way is such an useful tool to develop easier and faster
2) the teamwork coesion boost the process to overcome obstacles
3) work on small tasks helps you to focus on small problems at the time

Negative:
1) The coesion between team members is needed
2) Sometimes there is the need to adapt your solution to other's work 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

We didn't have a previous retrospective
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  
See previous answer

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

We will have a daily (or at least every two/three days) scrum to coordinate better the work between team members

We will divide the task to create a component form the task to test it, in order to have a better look on how we spent the time 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

Our team showed coesion between team members and each one of us was ready to help someone with less experience
